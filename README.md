# Most Touched Files

- Clone the repo, for example in `~/workspace'
- Should already be executable, but if not run `chmod +x ~/workspace/bashscripts/most-touched-files`
- Navigate to a directory where git has been initialized
- Run the file, `~/workspace/bashscripts/most-touched-files`

This is just a preliminary version. Output formatting is not optimal.
